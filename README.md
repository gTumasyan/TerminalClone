# TerminalClone

The project is a JavaScript application that replicates the basic UI of a terminal in a GUI using React and styled-components. The project was created as a learning exercise, particularly in the area of styled-components. I used it to practice creating custom styled components and gain a deeper understanding of how to design visually appealing user interfaces.
